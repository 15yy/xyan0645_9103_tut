Major assignment
These are the changes I want to make

# Part I: Imaging Technology Inspiration.
# I was inspired by the Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky's painting "Circles in a circle" and I wanted to incorporate elements of his painting into my assignment. For example straight lines, circles with different fill colours.
# As these elements fit in with the techniques learnt in the course, I thought they would be useful for the assignment.

# Part II: Coding Technique Exploration
# I wanted to use the Popping circle coding technique to make the various circular elements mentioned in Part 1 move, and the sub-technique also supports interaction.
